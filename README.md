# Celebrity Marketing Experiment

### Methodology and Experimental Design

I utilized Qualtrics to conduct a survey that aimed to understand how consumers view products, such as clothing, accessories, and cosmetics. Although the sample size (total number of survery respondents) was quite small, results were still shown to be significant. The survey assigned participants to either a control group or a treatment group when they entered the survey using Qualtrics randomization feature. The same experiment was conducted across six products: a gray hoodie, a leather shoulder bag, loafer slingbacks, sunglasses, a leather bomber jacket and mascara. After looking at the images, each participant estimated the price of the product and their intent to purchase it, on a scale of 1 to 5.


### Data Preprocessing

In order to prepare our dataset for analysis, the first step was to create a 'Treatment' column, a binary variable indicating if a participant was assigned to the treatment or control group. The dataset produced by the survey was extremely messy and unorganzied but after effectively transforming the data, the number of columns dropped from 62 columns to 29.
