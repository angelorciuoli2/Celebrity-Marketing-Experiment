# Celebrity Marketing Experiment

### Methodology and Experimental Design

I utilized Qualtrics to conduct a survey that aimed to understand how consumers view products, such as clothing, accessories, and cosmetics. Although the sample size (total number of survery respondents) was quite small, results were still shown to be significant. The survey assigned participants to either a control group or a treatment group when they entered the survey using Qualtrics randomization feature. The same experiment was conducted across six products: a gray hoodie, a leather shoulder bag, loafer slingbacks, sunglasses, a leather bomber jacket and mascara. After looking at the images, each participant estimated the price of the product and their intent to purchase it, on a scale of 1 to 5.
